	  General Description:
		DA9313 is a high-voltage power converter with a maximum output current of 10 A, suitable for 
		applications supplied from a dual (2S) Li-ion or Li-polymer stacked cell battery pack, or any input 
		voltage between 5 V and 10.5 V. The converter operates with efficiency during conversion of up to 
		98 %. Master/slave operation is offered, where a pair of devices can combine to double the peak 
		output current to 20 A. 
		Low profile external components and a minimum PCB footprint allow small circuit implementation in 
		compact applications. The pass devices are fully integrated therefore no external FETs are needed.  
		DA9313 utilizes a programmable soft start to limit the inrush current from the input node and secure 
		a slope controlled activation of the rails. It also implements integrated over-temperature and over-
		current protection for increased system reliability without the need for external sensing components. 
		Enable, low power mode entry and exit, and power good signals are available at configurable ports 
		flexibly supporting different applications and power-up or power-down scenarios.
