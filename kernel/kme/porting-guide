background:
	since there are so many projects and platforms in our company, it becomes more and more
	important to pay attention to portability for our new feature code. Otherwise it will be
	a disaster when we try to port our code from one project to another.

porting guide:
1. copy this whole directory (kernelroot/kernel/bsp_stablity) to your new project

2. modify the parent directory's Makefile to enable built-in this module.
	+obj-y += bsp_stability/

3.enable kernel configs these features require:
	so add these configs in your user config 
	+CONFIG_LOCKUP_DETECTOR=y
	+CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR=y
	+CONFIG_HARDLOCKUP_DETECTOR_NMI=y
	+CONFIG_DETECT_HUNG_TASK=y

	since rcu stall & rt throttle feature is included in the kernel without any config items.
	you don't need to do anything about them.

4.insert your monitor code in the stubs.
